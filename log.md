### **Post-Funk Night Debrief**

*A communal gathering to talk about work, life, and what happened at the Funkin Soul party last night*
**Thursdays · 9–11am · Blanchard’s Coffee, West Broad**
**Participants:** Ford Prior & Adam Woodward (+ the occasional soulfully curious drop-in)
**Initiated:** March 30, 2025
**Format:** Espresso-fueled think tank meets emotional intelligence dojo meets "wait, should we be journaling this?"

### **Session 1 – March 30, 2025**

**Theme:** *Executive Alignment and Jungle Vibes*
Our pilot episode set the tone: somewhere between a founder 1:1 and a post-ritual integration circle. Adam unpacked his mission to protect rainforests (*Jungle Keepers*), spread consciousness, and make frameworks sound cool to non-consultants. We dug into emotional reactivity at work—the kind of stuff that derails whole teams—and mapped the surprisingly deep terrain of “why am I doing this again?”
**Takeaway:** We’re not here to work—we’re here to *transform* (and maybe ship a deck about it).

### **Session 2 – April **

**Theme:** *AI, App Crashes, and the Sacred Terabyte*
We cracked open the vault on digital infrastructure: Adam has 20TB of “definitely vital” footage and nowhere chill to put it. Meanwhile, Ford live-debugged the *OurChants* app during coffee, because nothing says presence like a console log. The convo stretched from MacBook thermals to AI existentialism, with just enough spiritual subtext to justify the almond milk.
**Takeaway:** Enlightenment is just a well-deployed bug fix away. Also, backups.

### **Session 3 – May **

**Theme:** *Vision Quests and Ego Deaths (Light Roast Edition)*
Dating, naturally, but also the kind of strategic soul-searching you can only do in a coffee shop at 9am with a friend who’s spiritually dangerous. Guest appearance: Annie Ditz. Adam laid out his future vision (spoiler: it’s huge and involves April). Ford got grilled on why he’s doing any of the things he’s doing. Nothing like an existential gut-check with your cortado.
**Takeaway:** Your vision board might be gaslighting you—but your friend probably isn’t.

---

### **Session 4 – June, Pt. 1**

**Theme:** *Longing, Vaccines, and the Commune That Doesn’t Suck*
We rebranded longing from “problem” to “creative engine.” Dating became a proxy for authenticity. Ford mused on RNA vs. DNA and how light travels through time, and somehow it all made sense. The idea of building an intentional community came up (again), and no one said no, which feels dangerously like a yes.
**Takeaway:** Longing is your brand strategy; commune accordingly. And read the science—just, like, with soul.

### **Session 5 – June, Pt. 2**

**Theme:** *Gravity, Grief, and the Great AI Reckoning*
Adam kicked things off with his 1,000-question due diligence odyssey—basically a Google Form with existential consequences. He’s looking to automate it, because obviously the best decisions are made by robots now.

Ford dropped techworkersguild.org into the chat—his plan to help white-collar creatives cope with being gently offboarded by AI. Adam’s feedback: make it about growth, not gloom. Less “the robots took our jobs,” more “how do I turn this into my shamanic rebrand?”

We spiraled gracefully into cosmology. Hydrogen fusion vs. gravity: the OG tension. Ford waxed poetic about clarity through darkness, like Carl Sagan doing breathwork. Adam nodded and casually revealed he has a six-part workshop on this exact topic, just waiting for Rest Fest to call.

Closed out with a theology throwdown—Christianity’s expansion pack vs. Buddhism’s open-source chill. Also, a quick reminder that “carrying your cross” isn’t about suffering—it’s just taking radical responsibility without making a whole thing out of it.

**Takeaway:** Real growth is quiet, cosmic, and probably has a custom Airtable.
